## Chapter 10

### 10.8.6: Redirection of I/O

Create an Image File:

Image

Each pixel stores a certain color; often the rgb-model is used

A color is specified by its red, green, and blue parts

rgb color - with 0 <= r, g, b <= 255

(255, 0, 0) red

(0, 255, 0) green

(0, 0, 255) blue

(255, 255, 0) yellow

To define an image

    color depth
    width, height
    a sequence of rgb values
