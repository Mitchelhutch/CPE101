# CPE 101 Friday Week 2 Lecture and Lab
We use 3 different test functions

self.assertEqual(found , expected) - For ints

self.assertEqual(found , expected) - For floats

self.assertTrue(found) or self.assertFalse(found) - For boolean values
### 2.22 Variable Names- Local Variables (1)
Local variables defined in different functions having the same name are completely different from each other

Renaming the local variables does not change a function
